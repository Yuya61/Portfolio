However, I could\n            deliver a valuable website for my client. To have both perspectives\n            is an important practice for my career but I learned that more\n            effort and time is needed, I could understand the value of both\n            required elements to increase good teamwork.\n          </DarumaP>\n          {/* feedback section */}\n          <Feedback>\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n              <Image\n                src={DarumaArticle_7}\n                id=\"\"\n                style={{ width: \"4rem\", marginBottom: \"1rem\" }}\n              />\n            </div>\n            <DarumaH1 className=\"title\">\n              \" The outstanding product created by talented web specialist by\n              Yuya Hashirizaki that the product is very content even though I\n              couldn't make to him enough time to build up for our desirable web\n              site. \"\n            </DarumaH1>\n            <DarumaP style={{ fontSize: \"14px\", lineHeight: \"1.5\" }}>\n              I am pleased to be able to write this letter of recommendation for\n              Yuya Hashirizaki. In my opinion, Yuya is a hard-working\n              self-starter who invariably understands exactly what a project is\n              all about. That those skills were required especially in this\n              project. Our thoughts of the previous website were that it had old\n              fashioned style. So that we couldn’t understand why we have to\n              renew it until we get complaints from our regular customers. But\n              we couldn’t spend money to renovate for a new web site. I was just\n              about to start to search how do I find the proper person and, my\n              co-worker found out dependable web specialist among a lot of\n              candidates in IT industry. He consistently produced high-quality\n              work in a timely fashion so far invariably. After starting the\n              project with him, first of all, we have made meetings frequently\n              to reduce pain points for the future. It was a necessary thing\n              because we couldn’t invest much in this project so that, we had to\n              reduce the possibility to generate misunderstandings for each\n              other to avoid changes after finalized. I so much respect Yuya’s\n              attitude toward his work. I am therefore very pleased to be able\n              to recommend Yuya for future positions.\n            </DarumaP>\n          </Feedback>\n          {/* feedback section */}\n        </DarumaWrapper>\n      </motion.div>\n    </DarumaContainer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Article_Daruma;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
